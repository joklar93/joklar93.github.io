## Number Guesser
- I will think of a number between 1 and 99
- You will have 5 (may change) tries to guess the number I am thinking of
- I will give you two different respones. One for your guess being within 10 numbers and one for being further than 10 numbers
- Once you guess my number you win!

## Memory Game
- I will briefly show you a random number between 1 and 9
- You will have to remember that number and enter it
- If you get the number correct then I will show you the same number plus another
- This will continue until you can get to ten numbers or you get it wrong
